    <p style="width: 600px;">Traditional colorful balconies in Sliema, Malta.One of the first visual aspects to catch your eye while roaming the streets of Malta are the famously brightly painted wooden balconies that jut out from buildings over the streets below. The balconies are visually refreshing and definitely stand out against the sandstone buildings and streets that Malta is known for. The most colourful bunch of balconies can be found in Valletta, since this is where the trend was started back in the the mid 18th century and is now where most tourists flock to in order to see the famous architecture and revel in the history that engulfs the city.Traditional balconies certainly go a long way in defining the character of the Maltese urban landscape. Through their abundance of colours, materials, textures and decorative motifs, they enrich the visual aspect of Maltaâ€™s streets. Projecting into the urban space, they dominate and articulate it.

        When touched by the strong light so typical of the Mediterranean region they cast deep shadows on large expanses of plain stone walls creating a dynamic chiaro-scuro effect. Much like hanging gardens, the multitude of floral and foliage motifs in stone, wood and iron enliven both grand avenues and shady alleys.
