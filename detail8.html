    <p style="width: 600px;">Perge's ancient allure in Antalya, Turkey, showcased by the impressive ruins of a Greek temple adorned with majestic columns.Perge was situated on the coastal plain between the Rivers Catarrhactes (DÃ¼den Nehri) and Cestrus (Aksu), about 11 km from the mouth of the latter.[15][16][17][18]

        The history of the city dates back to the Late Chalcolitic Era or Early Bronze Age.[19] The Early Bronze Age pottery found in the Perga Acropolis is linked to the Early Bronze Age pottery traditions in Western Anatolia.[20] Excavations in the original settlement on the acropolis date it to the early Bronze Age, 4000-3000 BC.[21]
        
        From a bronze tablet discovered in 1986 in Hattusas, a treaty between the Hittite Great King Tudhaliya IV and his vassal, the king of Tarhuntassa, defined the latter's western border at the city "Parha" and the "Kastaraya River".[22] The river is assumed to be the classical Cestrus. West of Parha were the "Lukka Lands".[23] Parha likely spoke a late Luwian dialect like Lycian and that of the neo-Hittite kingdoms.</p></div>
